## Instructions to use virtual enviorment
This program uses a virtual enviorment (venv) to organize and have all the packages/modules in one spot for convenience and such. 
- To activate the venv simply run `source env/bin/activate` in the uppermost directory (you're most likely already there unless you moved).
- The terminal should show a change at the begginning of your line. To exit just run `deactivate`.
- The requirements for the program are all listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the relevant packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` while in the venv.

You can now run the program by doing `python main.py`
