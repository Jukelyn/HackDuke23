## Instructions to run
This program uses a virtual enviorment (venv) to organize and have all the packages/modules in one spot for convenience and such. To activate the venv simnply run `source env/bin/activate` in the uppermost directory (you're most likely already there unless you moved). At this point, the terminal should show a change at the begginning of your line. To exit just run `deactivate`.

The requirements for the program are all listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the relevant packages, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` while in the venv.
